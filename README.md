➤I don't mind being called any gender/pronoun - BUT! I do prefer the she/he pronouns mostly.

➤I can be a social/unsocial mix, most of the time, I don't int though. Its more comfortable if you approach me instead of I to you.

➤I can yap but I'm much more comfortable listening to you talk and adding onto that.

➤I absolutely enjoy watching anime and occasionally simple shows. My favorite is high school set romance stories, please do tell if you have a suggestion!!
