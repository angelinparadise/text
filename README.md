➤I don't mind being called any gender/pronoun - BUT! I do prefer the she/he pronouns mostly.

➤I can be a social/unsocial mix, most of the time, I don't int though. Its more comfortable if you approach me instead of I to you.

➤I can yap but I'm much more comfortable listening to you talk and adding onto that.

➤I enjoy listening to nearly everything BUT: Heavy NSFW, Fetishes, Kinks, Incest, Proships (I don't mind ones with small age gaps DEPENDING on the pairs' ages), and so on. If you're affiliated with these, please do tread carefully/DNI.

➤I absolutely enjoy watching anime and occasionally simple shows. My favorite is high school set romance stories, please do tell if you have a suggestion!!
